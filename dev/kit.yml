params:
  base:
    - ask: What IP should be used for your BOSH director?
      description: |
        This defines the IP that BOSH will be deployed on.
        It should be a an IP from the static IP pool on the network
        you are deploying the VM onto. Usually the BOSH manifest
        will handle this via `networks`, but the IP is
        required to create the SSL certificate for BOSH, prior
        to deploying. If you change this, make sure to
        have genesis regenerate your SSL certificate.
      param: static_ip
    - ask: What hostname will be used to access your BOSH director?
      description:
        This is the FQDN for the above  `static_ip`.
        If you do not have a DNS entry for that IP, or
        you can simply enter 'bosh'
      param: bosh_hostname

    - description: Override the default cloud-config network name for BOSH
      param: bosh_network

  bosh:
    - ask: What is the name of the BOSH director that will be deploying this BOSH VM?
      description: |
        This value is required for non-Proto-BOSH BOSHes.
        It indicates the target alias of the BOSH that
        will be used to deploy this BOSH. If you do
        not have a BOSH to deploy this BOSH from,
        you will want to use the `bosh-init` kit to
        deploy this as a Proto-BOSH.
      param: bosh

  warden-cpi:
    - description: |
        This should be a list of maps, which define port forwarding rules to allow
        traffic into the bosh-lite VM to reach container VMs deployed on it. If you
        wish to be able to hit a service deployed in the bosh-lite VM, it will need a
        port forwarding rule defined here.
        For example:
        - external_port: 443
          internal_port: 443
          internal_ip: 10.244.0.34
        - external_port: 80
          internal_port: 80
          internal_ip: 10.244.0.34
      param: port_forwarding_rules

    - ask: What is your Azure Subscription ID?
      description: |
        The Azure Subscription ID is used to identify which Azure account is being accessed
        by BOSH.
      vault: azure:subscription_id
    - ask: What Azure Resource Group will BOSH be deploying VMs into?
      description: |
        BOSH will deploy VMs into a single Resource Group on Azure, so that its VMs are able
        to talk to eachother. This must match the Resource Group that BOSH itself is deployed
        onto, so that the VMs can talk back to the BOSH director
      param: azure_resource_group
    - ask: What security group should be used as BOSH's default SG?
      description: |
        If no other security groups are specified when a VM is deployed, BOSH will apply
        this security group to it.
      param: azure_default_sg
    - description: |
        The azure_environment specifies which of Azure's offerings will be used
        to deploy VMs (AzureCloud, AzureChinaCloud, AzureUSGovernment, etc)
      param: azure_environment

  azure-init:
    - ask: What is the name of your Azure Virtual Network?
      description: |
